Decimal to Binary converter written in Python

Run in a terminal as

`python .\convertDecToBin.py [list of real numbers separated by spaces]`

The program will output the decimal numbers alongside their base 2 counterparts. e.g.

`python .\convertDecToBin.py 0.5 0.25 0.75` outputs

```
|     Base 10   |     Base 2    |
|---------------|---------------|
|      0.5      |      0.1      |
|      0.25     |      0.01     |
|      0.75     |      0.11     |
```
